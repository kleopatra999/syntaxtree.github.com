title: C# FastSpring API
---
<p>
We're currently happily relying on <a href="http://www.fastspring.com">FastSpring</a> to handle transactions for <a href="http://unityvs.com" target="_blank">UnityVS</a>. As advertised, we've experienced great customer support.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you purchase UnityVS through FastSpring, it will request licenses and notify our system of different events, such as new orders for instances.
</p>

<p>
Today we're opening the code of two libraries that we've using to interact with FastSpring:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/syntaxtree/SyntaxTree.FastSpring" target="_blank">SyntaxTree.FastSpring</a>: A library to validate the license requests the and different notifications that FastSpring performs.</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/syntaxtree/SyntaxTree.FastSpring.Api" target="_blank">SyntaxTree.FastSpring.Api</a>: A library to query the REST API that FastSpring exposes, currently limited to the scope of that we're using.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both are licensed under the permissive MIT/X11 license. We hope you'll find them useful.
