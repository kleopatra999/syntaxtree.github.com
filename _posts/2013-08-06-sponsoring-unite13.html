---
<p><a href="http://syntaxtree.com">SyntaxTree</a> is very proud to be one of the select few <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/unite2013/sponsors" target="_blank">platinum sponsor</a> of <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/" target="_blank">Unite 2013</a> in Vancouver.</p>

<p>This Unite will be the biggest Unity conference of the year, and marks a very special milestone for SyntaxTree and the <a href="http://unityvs.com" target="_blank">UnityVS</a> team, as it will be the one year anniversary of the initial release of UnityVS.</p>

<p>We will be doing a UnityVS demonstration during the conference. Keep an eye on the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/unite2013/schedule" target="_blank">Unite schedule</a> as sponsored sessions will be announced soon.</p>

<p>We're looking forward to meeting you at our booth and celebrating with you!</p>
