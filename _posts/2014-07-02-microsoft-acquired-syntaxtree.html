<p>It's an exciting day at SyntaxTree. We are very proud to announce that, as of today, SyntaxTree - including the team that built the <a href="http://unityvs.com">UnityVS plugin for Visual Studio</a> - has been acquired by Microsoft. We will be joining the Visual Studio team.</p>
 
<p>You can learn more from Microsoft's corporate vice president in charge of Visual Studio and head of the Developer Division, S. Somasegar, on <a href="http://aka.ms/soma-unity-vs">his blog</a>.</p>
 
<p>We cannot express strongly enough our appreciation of the support and encouragement we've received from the Unity game development community in the years leading to this milestone for our company. Thank you very, very much for your involvement. We could not have gotten here without you and we're looking forward to continuing to deliver more and better features in UnityVS.</p>
 
<p>Related to that, if you've purchased UnityVS we want to thank you again, as well as assure that you will continue to have access to the great UnityVS tools you've come to rely upon. We'll be reaching out to each UnityVS customer with further details on your ongoing service. Integration of UnityVS and Visual Studio is only going to get better, and we'll be looking for you to help us do that, through your feedback and continued support.</p>
