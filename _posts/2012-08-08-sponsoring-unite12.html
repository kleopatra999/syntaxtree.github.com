title: Sponsoring Unite 2012
---
<p>
<a href="http://syntaxtree.com">SyntaxTree</a> is a proud sponsor of <a href="http://unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unite 2012</a>, the annual Unity conference. This year, Unite is taking place in Amsterdam, Holland.

<p>
We'll have an exhibitor's table there to present <a href="http://unityvs.com">UnityVS</a>. This is going to be quite a milestone, both for the team, and the product. We hope to see you there!
