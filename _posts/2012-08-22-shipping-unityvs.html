title: UnityVS is available
---
<p>
We're a proud to announce that our first product, <a href="http://unityvs.com" target="_blank">UnityVS</a> is available for purchase.
</p>

<p>
We've been amazed by the amount of positive feedback we received during the private beta, and during <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/unite">Unite 2012</a>. We're proud to be part of the Unity ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Shipping UnityVS turns the page over a year of development and 5 months of private beta. We're already hard at work at fixing recently reported bugs, and at supporting new scenarios, like debugging Unity 4, or having support for Visual Studio 2012. You can check <a href="http://unityvs.com/roadmap">UnityVS's roadmap</a> to learn about what will be coming to UnityVS.

<p>
Many thanks to everyone who encouraged us and helped us with UnityVS.
